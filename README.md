# cacert-webui
#### Video Demo:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jOLHCiBOxg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jOLHCiBOxg)
#### Description:
The main idea of this project is to mimic the `ROOT CA`, `Intermediate CA`, and also the `Server CA`, passing through all the steps to:
- Create the folder structure
- Sign the files
- Improve the certificate knowledge

#### Use Case:
For those professionals who need to create a local `ROOT CA` to sign your own certificates, for troubleshooting, studies, labs, or any other purpose that you can think about, when talking about SSL/TLS/Certificates.

For me specifically, when working with `Red Hat Satellite`, or `Foreman`, enventually, I need to create custom certs to move on with my tests, and this tool will for sure help me in this process, making easier this certificate request `CSR`, and signing steps.

#### Code Structure:
For this application, I'm working with `Flask`, and the code was also divided in module, that I'm calling `cacert`

Also, after some implementation, I noticed that the lack of organization about the endpoints were causing issues, and then, I defined an standard
```
root ca
- /root_main
- /root_create
- /root_delete
- /root_verify

Intermediate
- /intermediate_main
- /intermediate_create
- /intermediate_delete
- /intermediate_verify
- /intermediate_verify_against_root_ca

bundle
- /bundle_main
- /bundle_download (nops)
- /bundle_view (nops)

sign certificate
- /sign_certificate_main
- /sign_certificate_upload_sign
- /sign_certificate_download
- /sign_certificate_view

custom ssl certificate
- /custom_ssl_certificate_main
- /custom_ssl_certificate_create
- /custom_ssl_certificate_delete
- /custom_ssl_certificate_view
- /custom_ssl_certificate_verify
```

At this moment, I'm not using all of them, but for sure, the nomenclature helped, specially when doing troubleshootings.

#### Functions:

##### Functions under `app.py`
- `sign_certificate_main()`
  - Endpoint to handle all the sign certificate calls. Visualization, deletion, and signing.
- `bundle_main()`
  - Endpoint to handle all the bundle/ca-chain certificate calls. Visualization, and download.
- `intermediate_delete()`
  - Endpoint responsible to remove the intermediate folder, and also responsible to revoke the certificate that was signed for that specific intermediate. Any time that a new one is created, a new `ID` is created, and any time that the intermediate is removed, the respective `ID` is also revoked.
- `root_delete()`
  - Endpoint responsible to remove the entire structure, including the `ROOT CA`, and the `Intermediate CA` as well.
- `intermediate_verify_against_root_ca()`
  - Enpoint responsible to verify if the `Intermediate CA` certificate is ok, when checking it against the `ROOT CA`
- `intermediate_verify()`
  - Endpoint responsible to verify the `Intermediate CA` certificate.
- `root_verify()`
  - Endpoint responsible to verify the `ROOT CA` certificate.
- `root()`
  - Endpoint responsible for the `ROOT CA` structure, certificates, and anything related to the `ROOT CA`
- `intermediate()`
  - Endpoint responsible for the `Intermediate CA` structure, certificates, and anything related to the `Intermediate CA`.
- `index()`
  - Endpoint "/", where the first call will land.
- `web()`
  - Endpoint for testing the web template
- `root_ca()`
  - Endpoint that will open the `ROOT CA` web page
- `intermediate_ca()`
  - Endpoint that will open the `Intermediate CA` web page
- `github()`
  - Endpoint that will open the `GitHub` web page
- `custom_ssl_certificate_main()`
  - Endpoint that will open the `Custom SSL Certificate` main web page
- `custom_ssl_certificate_create()`
  - Endpoint that will open the `Custom SSL Certificate` create web page
- `custom_ssl_certificate_delete()`
  - Endpoint that will open the `Custom SSL Certificate` delete web page

# To Deploy via Virtual Environment
- Create a Python Virtual Environment
```
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/cacert-webui
```
- Load the Virtual Environment
```
source ~/.venv/cacert-webui/bin/activate
(cacert-webui) user@local ~ %
```
- Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/Qikfix/cacert-webui.git
cd cacert-webui
```
- Install the Python Modules via Requirements.txt
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Start the Application
```
flask run --debug
...
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

# To Deploy the Container Using Podman
- Install podman
```
dnf install podman -y
```
- Execute the container
```
podman run -d --rm --name pdf-plus -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/waldirio/cacert-webui:latest
```

And now, you should be able to access your application via http://localhost:5000


### You can also pull the image using docker
- To pull the image
```
docker pull ghcr.io/waldirio/cacert-webui:latest

#### Container Friendly
Soon, I'll add the steps that you can follow, and just download the container, which will allow you to be executing this environment, with no further work. If you are already a `podman` or `docker` user, it should be very easy for you.

I'll keep you posted about it!
